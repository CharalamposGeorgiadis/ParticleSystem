# ParticleSystem
C app using OpenGL that simulates a 3D particle system with collision detection and handling.
Particles are being constantly created in a defined position with random initial speed, color and mass. They move due to the influence of gravity and wind and fall and jump
elastically on the floor.

The app uses double buffering, and depth buffering.

NOTE: If using Microsoft Visual Studio make sure that the Active solution platform is x86 (Build -> Configuration Manager).
